# Thermal_COVID
This is the archived scripts and data for our work in Thermal_COVID. Qmd files in the Scripts directory provides codes for generating figures and tables in our main text and supplementary materials. The Dataset directory contains processed panel data that serves as the input data in the scripts.
Note that our original TI is identified within the height range of 810 metres above the ground. So in scripts we always filter TI with the base height of 0 metre, that is, occuring from the gound as the modeling subjects.
